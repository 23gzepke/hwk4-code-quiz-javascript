# hwk4-code-quiz-javascript
Objective:

This is a timed quiz that the user tries to answer as many questions correctly and as quickly as possible.

Once the user chooses to begin the quiz, they will have two minutes (120 seconds) to answer 6 questions. If the user answers a question incorrectly, they will have 20 seconds docked from the remaining time. 

The quiz will end once the user has either answered all the questions or has run out of time. The user's score will be determined by the remaining time at the end of the quiz. The user will also have the option to enter their name into a textarea to be entered into local storage, along with their score.

There is a seperate layout for the stored names and scores the user can access at the end of the quiz or before they begin a new one. This layout also has the option to delete all stored scores if they so choose from local storage.

The project consists of multiple JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files to achieve the desired effects.
